* Open Command line:   Start menu -> Run  and type cmd
* Type:   C:\python37\python.exe            
Exercise\app.py
* Or if your system is configured correctly, you can drag and drop your 
script from Explorer onto the Command Line window and press enter.

then you can visualize the date running Exercise/DataVisualization.py
the result will gonna be in reports file


## Docker
follow this instruction if you wish to run the code using docker 

first of all 
> run cmd/terminal  according to your os.

then type
 > docker build -t myImage.

After your image has been built successfully, you can run it as a container. In your terminal, run the command docker images to view your images. You should see an entry for **myImage**. Run the new image by entering:
